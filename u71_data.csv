u71,m4,L5201,"They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the ""Don't Disturb"" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.",
u71,m4,L5197,Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.,

u71,m4,L5060,Doesn't it get... Tiring?,
u71,m4,L5060,"Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?",
u71,m4,L5057,"I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.",

u71,m4,L5036,What?,
u71,m4,L5033,Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.,
u71,m4,L5028,"I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.",
u71,m4,L5023,You just drove by it.,

u71,m4,L5007,"Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.",
u71,m4,L5002,Half a million.,
u71,m4,L5002,I been waiting a long time for some money.,

u71,m4,L4994,"Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.",
u71,m4,L4974,Maybe I don't like the way you ask.,
u71,m4,L4969,"I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.",
u71,m4,L4969,"You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.",
u71,m4,L4964,Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...,

u71,m4,L4882,"Hey, you wanna bet?",
