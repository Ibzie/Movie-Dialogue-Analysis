u55,m3,L3745,"I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.",
u55,m3,L3738,"Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.",

u55,m3,L3724,"Yes, really, thank you very much.",

u55,m3,L3904,Has it been exposed to any sun before now?,
u55,m3,L3904,Any ideas about the colour?,
u55,m3,L3896,But you don't have any idea as to what it is?,
u55,m3,L3889,Any clue as to what it is?,
u55,m3,L3889,How can you tell it was deliberately buried?,
u55,m3,L3868,I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.,
u55,m3,L3837,"No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.",
u55,m3,L3832,"I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.",
u55,m3,L3824,I see.,
u55,m3,L3824,What do you mean?,
u55,m3,L3824,Thank you.,
u55,m3,L3817,"Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.",
u55,m3,L3817,When do we arrive at Clavius?,
u55,m3,L3817,"Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.",
