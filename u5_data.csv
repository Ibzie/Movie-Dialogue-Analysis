u5,m0,L1007,What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?,
u5,m0,L1007,You set me up.,

u5,m0,L247,"So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.",
u5,m0,L151,The people at this school are so incredibly foul.,
u5,m0,L133,"I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.
