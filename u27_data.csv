u27,m2,L3177,I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...,
u27,m2,L3177,You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?,

u27,m2,L3093,Are you married?,
u27,m2,L3089,I will if they don't send me back.,

u27,m2,L3062,You're a cop - you'll never believe me.,
u27,m2,L3062,"I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.",
